# hybrid-cnn-fuzzy-xai-medical-diagnosis
Explainable AI system for medical diagnosis using a hybrid CNN and fuzzy logic framework.

## Methodology

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Learns latent clinical patterns from medical data
- Provides high predictive performance

### Fuzzy Logic Layer
- Converts CNN outputs into interpretable rule-based reasoning
- Enhances transparency and trust in model predictions

This hybrid architecture bridges the gap between black-box deep learning
and explainable decision-making.
